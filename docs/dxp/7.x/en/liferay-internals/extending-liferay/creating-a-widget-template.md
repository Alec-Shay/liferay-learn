# Creating a Widget Template

Widget templates are used to customize the appearance and functionality of various existing widgets. Creating a widget template allows you to use a script to adapt the widget however you see fit. You can create a widget template for many out-of-the-box portlets, such as the _Asset Publisher_ and _Media Gallery_ widgets.

1. Add a name for your widget template.

1. Under the _Script_ section, click into the body of the template editor.

1. Click one of the fields in the _Fields_ menu to insert that field into the editor. The value of the field will be displayed when your widget template is used.

    ```note::
       Clicking any of the fields in the menu will insert the field name wherever the cursor is. You can also begin typing a field name yourself (starting with "${") to show suggestions for auto-completion.
    ```

Now that you have created a widget template, you can configure the corresponding widget to use your template. See [Customizing a Widget with a Widget Template](./customizing-a-widget-with-a-widget-template) for more information.
