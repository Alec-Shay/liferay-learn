# Introduction to Themes

## What is a Theme?

* What is a theme? Is it needed? What can you do with it?
* Maybe link to the Getting Started article for changing a Site's theme to ground discussion

Maybe reference the "theme anatomy", and if possible show a picture (otherwise link to an article in the same vein)

## Possible Section on Just Using Themes in general in Liferay UI?

[Screenshot of page with one of the non-classic themes?]

Not sure if there's enough content past, how to change a theme (with link), for a whole section... but if so, put that here

## Introduction to Clay and CSS Development?

Not sure if it's needed to go into full detail here, but at least a general overview of how they tie into theme development, and why that's important. Then link to respective articles for more information

## Developing Themes

* How do you get started creating/developing themes?
    Not getting too deep into explanation, but pointing to an overview of theme development workflow possibly

* Just pointing to some of the major topics and linking out to their respective articles

### Upgrading Themes

* Allude to amount of work that goes into upgrading themes
* Point to those articles...

## Extending Existing Themes

* How do you extend an existing theme?
* Again, listing out with links
    * installing themelets
    * changing the base theme
    * injecting additional context variables/functionality
    * Packaging independent UI resources
    * overwriting and extending Liferay Theme Tasks

## Importing Resources with a Theme?

Could potentially turn into another "list of links" sort of section... not sure what else to do with it (or which ones right off the bat are important enough for direct mention)

## Tooling?

Not sure if this is a necessary section, but maybe good to rule out need for a general "tools" article?

* If so, list out a bit like prerequisites, link to respective articles. Include setting up npm nevironment, Gradle plugins do we want to also bring up Maven plugins?), etc.
