# Similar Results Widget Templates

> **Available:** Download the app through Liferay Marketplace.

The [Similar Results widget](./similar-results.md) shows search results similar to the _main asset_ that's selected on the page. By default, similar results render using a _Compact Layout_ [widget template](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360029132571-Styling-Widgets-with-Widget-Templates), showing a list of hyperlinked titles.

The Compact Layout looks like this:

Two additional widget templates are available out of the box for the Similar Results widget: _List Layout_ and _Card Layout_.

The List Layout looks like this:
![The list layout shows a summary of the asset, and includes the title, the User, modified date, asset type, and a snippet of content.](./similar-results/images/04.png)

The Card Layout looks like this:
![Similar to the list, the card layout puts the asset's summary fields into a card container.](./similar-results/images/05.png)
