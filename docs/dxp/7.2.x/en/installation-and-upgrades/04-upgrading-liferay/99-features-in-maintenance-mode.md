# Features in Maintenance Mode

Liferay may cease enhancing certain products or capabilities at a designated time. The affected products or capabilities are put into _maintenance mode_. During this mode, Liferay actively supports and provides bug fixes for the product or capability in accordance with the subscribers' subscription level and the end of service life policies of the compatible Liferay DXP version.

Maintenance mode does not necessarily mean that deprecation in a future Liferay DXP version is planned for the product or capability. It only means that enhancements aren't being made for the current Liferay DXP development cycle. 

As of Liferay DXP 7.2, these products and capabilities have transitioned into maintenance mode:

- Liferay Connected Services
- Liferay Sync
- Liferay Mobile Experience (Liferay Screens, Liferay Mobile SDK, Liferay Push)
- Staging
