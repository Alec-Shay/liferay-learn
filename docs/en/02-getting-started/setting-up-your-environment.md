# Setting up Your Environment

Before beginning development and deployment, developers planning to create modules to DXP Cloud should install the requisite environments first. There are various development tools and frameworks that developers can use but all  deployment is done via the Github project created during the provisioning process.

In order to set a DXP Cloud local environment for development, the following are required:

## Personal Credentials

* A [Github Account](https://github.com/)

## Technical Requirements

* [JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or later
* [Gradle 4+](http://www.gradle.org/downloads)
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

The following might be helpful:

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)
* [Command Line Tool](../10-reference/03-command-line-tool.md)
* [Liferay IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10739-liferay-intellij-plugin)

## Additional Information

Note that Liferay DXP Cloud has basically the same environment requirements as Liferay Workspace. Developers who are familiar with creating Liferay Workspace using [Liferay Dev Studio](https://customer.liferay.com/downloads?p_p_id=com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_productAssetCategoryId=118191007&_com_liferay_osb_customer_downloads_display_web_DownloadsDisplayPortlet_fileTypeAssetCategoryId=118191038), [Maven](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017885592-Maven-Workspace), or [Liferay IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10739-liferay-intellij-plugin) will have most of the environments already set up.
