# Setting up Your Environment

Before beginning deployment in Liferay DXP Cloud, developers planning to create modules for DXP Cloud should install the required tools. There are various development tools and frameworks that developers can use to create their customizations, but deployment to DXP Cloud begins with the GitHub project created during the provisioning process.

In order to set up a local environment for development with DXP Cloud, the following are required:


* **[JDK 1.8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) or later**: required for running Liferay DXP locally

* **[Gradle 4+](http://www.gradle.org/downloads)**: used to run any of various build commands for Liferay DXP and DXP Cloud

* **[Git](https://git-scm.com/)**: necessary for adding changes to deploy to DXP Cloud

* **[GitHub Account](https://github.com/)**: required for pushing code changes to GitHub and sending pull requests

The following tools may also be helpful for developers:

* [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/index.html)
* DXP Cloud's [Command Line Tool](../10-reference/03-command-line-tool.md)
* [Liferay IntelliJ Plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/10739-liferay-intellij-plugin)
