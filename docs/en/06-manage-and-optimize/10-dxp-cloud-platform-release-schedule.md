# DXP Cloud Platform Release Schedule

DXP Cloud is an evolving product with updates and features being released at a steady pace. Amidst that effort, we also want to provide a dependable environment for our customers to be informed and well planned as they use the platform. This is why Liferay has established a transparent release cadence strategy.

The release strategy consists of two release windows, or opportunities, for Liferay to release changes or fixes to the DXP Cloud Platform. Those windows fall on **Tuesdays and Thursdays from 8 am to 8 pm PST**.

Nearly all releases can be accomplished with no downtime or outage to the customer's application or to the DXP Cloud Platform interfaces. As with any system, the larger the change, the higher the risk of unexpected downtime.

To make this transparent to the customer, Liferay separates releases into three different types: Patches, Minor, and Major. Each release type represents a different level of risk for downtime. Please see the table below for a breakdown of downtime risk for each release type.

## Downtime Risk Assessment

| Release | DXP Cloud Console | DXP Cloud API |	Customer Application |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Patches | Low | Low | Low |
| Minor | Low | Low | Low |
| Major | Mid | Mid | Mid |

Patches are released on an ad hoc basis but always applied to the DXP Cloud Platform within the defined release window. Minor releases are on a monthly schedule, and Major releases are on a quarterly schedule.

**Please Note**: this release schedule is a projection and Liferay reserves the right to not utilize any release window or initiate an unscheduled maintenance/release if it deems it critical to the management of the system or customer applications.

Liferay will communicate with customers about any known downtime due to maintenance/releases at least **14 days in advance**, with the exception of urgent situations in which Liferay will communicate **4 hours in advance**.
