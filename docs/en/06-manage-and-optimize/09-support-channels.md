# Support Channels

Liferay Cloud will provide Support Services to customers only through communication with the *Designated Contacts* that are associated with the customer project.

There are three main support channels to solve any issues that may arise with the Liferay DXP Cloud product: self-service documentation, submitting a ticket, and via phone. For self-service documentation and ticket submission, Liferay Help Center is available for subscribers.

*Self-service documentation* is available in Help Center and includes both official documents and knowledge base articles. Help Center documentation is always available to help customers navigate issues and knowledge base articles are continually added by Liferay Support for reference.

*Ticketing* is available in Help Center for authorized contacts and response times may vary based on the severity of the issues as outlined in the Severity Levels.

*Phone support* is provided from six Support Centers located across the globe. A customer’s designated Support Region is determined by the customer’s country of purchase. Each Support Center maintains the following Support Business Hours, except during [observed holidays](https://www.liferay.com/support/holiday-calendar), for its respective Support Region. All Support Region phone numbers can be found on our [Contact Us](https://help.liferay.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017784212?_ga=2.254167624.1908736764.1562000563-1350017715.1560788053) page.
