# Team Activities

To see the team members' activities, click _Activities_ on the left menu. The page is divided into two sections:  _Builds and Deployments_ and _General_.

The _General_ section on the _Activities_ lists each event, the person who performed it, and the time stamp.

The _Builds and Deployments_ section lists each build ID and deployment to that environment. Clicking on a build ID redirects to the _Builds_ page.
