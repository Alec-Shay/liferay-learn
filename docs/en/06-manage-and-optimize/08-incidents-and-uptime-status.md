# Incidents and Uptime Status

When an incident is reported to Liferay Support, both Support and Product Engineering teams at Liferay work together to resolve the incident and communicate it to you. Response times vary based on the Severity Level of the reported incident, and the team works very quickly to find the best solution. Liferay Cloud does not guarantee resolution times, and a resolution may consist of a fix, workaround, service availability or other solution that Liferay Cloud deems reasonable.

## Severity Levels

Below is how Liferay Cloud defines the severity of the issue that is reported. Response times (Acknowledge Receipt Times) to customer issues are based on the Severity that is reported. *This is an overview of standard Severity Levels, but details are _subject to your legal agreement with Liferay_.*

| Severity Level | Description | Response Time SLA |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Severity 1 (“High”) | Production environment is completely shut down or severely impacted | 1 Hour |
| Severity 2 (“Normal”) | Any environment is functioning with limited capabilities or is unstable with periodic interruptions | 2 business hours |
| Severity 3 (“Low”) | Any environment is fully functional but there are observed errors that do not impact the usability | 1 business day |

Severity 1 (“High”) Incidents: A Severity 1 Incident means for purposes of the Liferay Cloud Infrastructure (i) the production environment for the Customer Application is completely shut down or severely impacted; or for purposes of Liferay Software (ii) production environment system is severely impacted or completely shut down, or (iii) system operations or mission-critical applications are inoperable, or (iv) mission-critical applications that have experienced repeated material system interruptions that are effectively making the applications inoperable.

Severity 2 (“Normal”) Incidents: A Severity 2 Incident means for purposes of the Liferay Cloud Infrastructure (i) any environment for the Customer Application is functioning with limited capabilities or is unstable with periodic interruptions; or for purposes of Liferay Software (ii) the system is functioning with limited capabilities, or (iii) is unstable with periodic interruptions, or (iv) mission-critical applications, while not inoperable, have experienced material system interruptions.

Severity 3 (“Low”) Incidents: A Severity 3 Incident means for purposes of the Liferay Cloud Infrastructure (i) either environment for the Customer Application is fully functional, but there are observed errors that do not impact the usability of an environment; or for purposes of Liferay Software (ii) the system is fully functional, but there are observed errors that do not impact the usability of the system. 

Liferay will work on Incidents designated as Severity 1 twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week, (“24x7”), provided that if resolution of a Customer’s issue requires input from members of Customer’s support team and they are not available to work during those hours , Liferay reserves the right to lower the severity level to match the actual business impact, if applicable, until Customer’s support team is available to support the incident on a 24x7 basis.

## Incident Escalation Path

Once an incident is reported to Liferay Support, a ticket is created to track the incident and Liferay Support will lead in communicating with you. The following path is generally how Liferay Support works with you to resolve the incident.

INITIAL RESPONSE

Liferay Support will give an initial notification that the incident has been received and will begin looking into the problem, trying to identify the root issue. Customer Support Engineers may request more information from you in order to better understand the incident.

INVESTIGATE AND REPRODUCE

Liferay Support will investigate the root cause of the incident and attempt to reproduce based on the information provided by you. If it is clear that the issue requires more management, the Customer Support Engineer will involve necessary parties to help investigate and reproduce, depending on the situation and the product. Once the incident is confirmed and reproduced, Liferay Support and Product Engineering teams work together to develop a solution.

MITIGATION OR FIX

While an incident is in progress, Support and Product teams will attempt to mitigate the issue. Mitigation is when Support or Product might be able to lessen the impact of an issue by temporarily providing additional resources or insights into an incident. Workarounds might also be provided with steps to solve the underlying issue.

FIX DELIVERY

Liferay Support will deliver a fix, along with instruction, through the Help Center ticket. After delivering the fix, the Customer Support Engineer will wait for you to verify that the fix worked before closing the Help Center ticket. Liferay Support will wait for you to verify that the fix solved the incident in your environment.

After 30 days of non-response by you on a Help Center ticket, Liferay Support will automatically close the ticket.

FOLLOW UP

While an incident is ongoing, Liferay Support will provide regular updates and check-ins about the progress toward a resolution, including any mitigation or workarounds. Support will also give updates on fix progress and any changes in status.

## Uptime Commitment & Status

For real-time updates on the status of the Liferay Cloud Platform, all customers should subscribe to the [Liferay Cloud Status](https://status.liferay.cloud/) page. Click on “Subscribe to Updates” and select the type of notification that is most convenient for you.

*The following Uptime commitments are general standards, but final details are _subject to your legal agreement with Liferay_.* Liferay Cloud commits that Customer’s Project will have a Monthly Infrastructure Availability (“MIA”) of 99.95% or greater. MIA is calculated using the following equation:

MIA = 100 – ((DT/43800) * 100)

Where “DT” (downtime) means the total minutes of unplanned downtime in a calendar month that is not planned downtime. For clarity, twenty-two (22) minutes of unplanned downtime in a month would result in a total monthly availability of 99.94%.

Liferay shall provide Customer with email notification at least 72 hours in advance of planned downtime which will include the following information:

* Reason for outage
* Expected downtime
* Contact information

Downtime for which Liferay has provided such advance notice shall be deemed “planned downtime”.
