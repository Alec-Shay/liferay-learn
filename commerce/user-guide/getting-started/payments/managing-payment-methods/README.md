The _Edit Payment Method_ UI has three tabs: _Details_, _Configuration_ and _Restrictions_. The _Details_ and _Restrictions_ tabs share the same fields across the different payment methods. However, each payment method has a unique configuration screen.

**Details**: Each details screen contains fields that determine how the payment method is rendered in the Checkout widget.
