# Creating a New Account Group

This article documents how to create an account group. Account Groups allow accounts to be grouped based on your criteria, such as grouping accounts by geographic region (US West Coast, the Midwest, and the South). Vendors can then apply discounts or target marketing campaigns to specific Account Groups.

To create an account group:

1. Go to the _Control Panel_ → _Users_ → _Accounts Groups_.
1. Click the (+) button to add a new account group.
1. Enter a name: _US East Coast_.
1. Click _Save_.
1. The _Accounts_ link appears. Click the _Accounts_ link.

1. Check the boxes for every Account to be included in the _US East Coast_ Account Group. (In this example, there is only one account (Acme International) that was created in the [Creating a New Account](../creating-a-new-account/README.md) article.)
