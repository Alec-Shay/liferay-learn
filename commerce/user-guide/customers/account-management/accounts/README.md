# Accounts

> Do not push up yet. Need to explore personal accounts still.

Liferay Commerce stores information about customers in an account. For the _B2B_ store type, an individual customer _must_ be assigned to an account in order to make a purchase.

Accounts store account-specific information like: shipping and billing addresses and, if applicable, a VAT number.

To manage accounts and the associated users, use the _Accounts_ widget in the _Control Panel_.

## Account Types

There are two types of accounts: business and personal.

A **personal account** stores information about an individual user.

A **business account** stores information about a business. Multiple users can be associated with a business account, and can be assigned unique [Account Roles](../account-management/account-roles/README.md).

The type of accounts you use is determined by your [site type](../../gettings-started/site-management-basics/site-and-site-types/README.md).
