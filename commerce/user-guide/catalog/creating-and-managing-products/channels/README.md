# Channels

Liferay Commerce provides tools to enable and empower a variety of store models. By default, Products added to any catalog are visible *globally* - that is they are visible across all sites added to a Liferay Commerce installation. In some circumstances, store administrators may want to limit product visibility by certain criteria.

**Channels** are one of the methods by which store administrators may configure product visibility across their stores. Channels are currently assigned in a 1:1 relationship with sites. This enables administrators to manage one (or more) catalogs, while administering multiple sites and offering configurable subsets of products to each site.

>Current feedback: ensure that Channels represent stores and product distribution - as well as orders received - in the abstract. It is less about filtering products by site and more about providing a useful abstraction over where a customer may sell something

>Future versions of Commerce may further extend Channels functionality to increase scope beyond Sites to other attributes like: Account Groups, Countries, and Regions.
